The main feature is the push notification reminder that alarms the user that he/she has enters within a radius of an address attached to a reminder. This will allow the user to always be on top of their non-urgent but important tasks or duties. Live product on TestFlight can be found <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/do291tga">here</a>
